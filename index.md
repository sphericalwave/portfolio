    <p class="mb-2">I've spent over a decade pressure-testing strategies for nutrition and conditioning in the crucible of jiu-jitsu. One of my greatest passions is helping people reach the next level. While everyone is unique, I've discovered many principles over the years that challenge conventional thinkingâ€”principles that can help you shed those last 15 pounds and achieve gymnast-level strength, flexibility, and speed.</p>


    <p class="mb-2">A core tenets for me is <em>Think Global, Act Local</em> which drives my advocacy for interdisciplinary thinking. Engineering is my powerhouse approach to making a difference.</p>

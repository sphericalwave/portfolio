# About

Hi, I'm Aaron.

![image](/public/aaron_sun_profile.png)

I am a multi-faceted individual with a passion for life and a drive to succeed in all that I do. I have been working as a software developer since 2017, and my expertise in this field has provided me with a strong foundation of technical knowledge and problem-solving skills.

In addition to my work as a software developer, I am also an electrical engineer. I bring a unique set of skills and knowledge to my work, and I have a strong foundation in electrical engineering principles and a passion for developing innovative solutions to complex problems. Throughout my career, I have taken on challenging projects and consistently delivered high-quality results.

My passion for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is just as strong as my passion for engineering and software development. As a dedicated practitioner, I have been training and competing for several years and have honed my skills through rigorous training and competition. Through jiujitsu, I have found a sense of focus and discipline that extends into all areas of my life. Jits is a great social network and a source of much friendship and laughter. It's also a great motivator to tune my nutrition and conditioning.

When I'm not working or training, I can often be found on the slopes, snowboarding, or strumming my guitar. These activities provide a welcome escape from the demands of work and allow me to let loose and have fun. I also make time for my mental and physical well-being by studying geometry and philosophy, weight training, practicing yoga, and meditating.

Family is an integral part of who I am, and I am blessed to have an incredibly supportive and loving family. My parents have been instrumental in shaping me into the person I am today, and I am grateful for their unwavering love and support. My brother, two sisters, and four nieces and two nephews bring joy and laughter into my life and are a constant source of inspiration. They are my biggest cheerleaders and my rock, and I am proud to call them my family.

Lastly, as a dog father, I have a deep love and appreciation for my four-legged companion Sir Alfred of Grem. Whether we are out on a walk, racing each other on a skateboard, playing in the backyard, or simply lounging on the couch, my dog brings me joy and unconditional love.

In conclusion, I am a multi-talented individual who is passionate about life and dedicated to being the best version of myself. Through my work as a software developer and electrical engineer, my training and competition in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, my snowboarding, guitar playing, and being a dog father, as well as my commitment to my personal growth through studying, weight training, yoga, and meditation, I strive to bring balance and fulfillment to my life. My family is my greatest source of strength and inspiration, and I am grateful to have them by my side. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow and develop, and I can't wait to see what the future holds.

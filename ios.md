# AudioWave

AudioWave is an app I built that allows you to play two playlists at the same time. This is useful for listening to goal or positive suggestions repeatedly with background music.

<!-- "AudioWave, is an innovative app that lets you play your voice notes with background music. Whether you're recording a new idea, jotting down a grocery list, or simply want to add some extra flair to your daily musings, VoiceBeat has got you covered. Choose from a wide selection of background tracks or use your own music, and listen to your voice notes come to life. With its simple and intuitive interface, VoiceBeat is the perfect companion for anyone who wants to add a musical touch to their voice notes."

# Rick and Morty

This is a code challenge that is interesting because of the requirement to cache photos from an api that are lazily loaded as well as implement an infinite list similar to twitter. 
It's not on the app store because it's a technical demo and there are rules against using proprietary content.

  	<p>AudioWave is an app I built that allows you to play two playlists simultaneously. This is useful for repeatedly listening to goals or positive suggestions with background music.

Whether you're recording a new idea, jotting down a grocery list, or simply want to add some extra flair to your daily musings, VoiceBeat has got you covered.

  	<p>This code challenge is interesting because of the requirement to cache photos from a lazily loaded API and implement an infinite list similar to Twitter. 
It's not on the app store because it's a technical demo, and there are rules against using proprietary content.

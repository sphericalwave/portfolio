Here it is from the legend of Biernacki.

Rob & Stephan do a phenomenal job of teaching conceptual jiujitsu.

Rob's assertion is base, posture, structure is the most important concept in Jiujitsu.

Base is a platform to deliver and absorb force.

Posture is the alignment of your spinal alignment.

Structure is the most efficient use of your limbs.

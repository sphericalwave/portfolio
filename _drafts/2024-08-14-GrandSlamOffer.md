Jiujitsu is an incredible martial art.  
But it's not easy.  
Learning techniques, drilling and sparring are what you pay for  
And that is quite the rabbit hole  

In my experience the thing that trips up most people is pain and injuries  
If you're a mutant athlete like Nicky Rod who can do the splits and backbridges while being lightning quick that's one thing  
But the truth is that is exceedingly rare  
For the rest of us we need conditioning and nutrition off the mats  
And that's another rabbit hole  
Luckily that's something I can help you with  

Technical progression is one thing  
Improving the performance of your suit is another  
And then there's the mental game which is probably king

# HVDC Field Engineering

As a field engineer during the construction phase of the Soldiers Pond HVDC (High Voltage Direct Current) converter station, I was a key member of the project team responsible for ensuring that the station was built to the highest standards and in accordance with the design specifications. My main focus was to monitor the construction activities on site, and ensure that the work was being done safely, efficiently, and to the required quality.

I worked closely with the contractors and other engineers, to resolve any technical issues that arose during the construction phase, and to ensure that the project was delivered on time and within budget. I also had to maintain a detailed knowledge of the construction schedule, so I could plan and coordinate the installation of the HVDC equipment and systems.

As a field engineer, I had to have a strong understanding of electrical engineering principles, HVDC technology, and construction practices. I also had to be able to work effectively in a fast-paced, dynamic environment, and be able to manage multiple tasks and priorities. Strong communication and interpersonal skills were also important, as I had to work closely with a wide range of stakeholders, including contractors, other engineers, and project managers.

The construction of the Soldiers Pond HVDC converter station was a complex and challenging project, but it was also extremely rewarding. I was able to use my skills and knowledge to make a real difference, and to contribute to the successful delivery of a critical piece of infrastructure. I was proud to be part of a team that built a station that will provide reliable, high-quality power transmission for many years to come.

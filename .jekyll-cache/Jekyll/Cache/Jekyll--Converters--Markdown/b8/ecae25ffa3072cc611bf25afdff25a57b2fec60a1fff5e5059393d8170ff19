<p>Here it is from the legend of Biernacki.</p>

<p>Rob &amp; Stephan do a phenomenal job of teaching conceptual jiujitsu.</p>

<p>Robâ€™s assertion is base, posture, structure is the most important concept in Jiujitsu.</p>

<p>Base is a platform to deliver and absorb force.</p>

<p>Posture is the alignment of your spinal alignment.</p>

<p>Structure is the most efficient use of your limbs.</p>

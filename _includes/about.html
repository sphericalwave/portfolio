      I've spent over a decade pressure-testing strategies for nutrition and
      conditioning in the crucible of jiu-jitsu. One of my greatest passions is
      helping people reach the next level. While everyone is unique, I've
      discovered many principles over the years that challenge conventional
      thinkingâ€”principles that can help you shed those last 15 pounds and
      achieve gymnast-level strength, flexibility, and speed.

    <p class="mb-2">
      A core tenet for me is <em>Think Global, Act Local</em> which drives my
      advocacy for interdisciplinary thinking. Engineering is my powerhouse
      approach to making a difference.
